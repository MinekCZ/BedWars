How to Setup?

This can be quite complicated, so set aside around 30 Minutes!

1. Create Arena. Type /bw create (name)

2. Go to setup mode, it will instruct you the command for that upon step 1

3. Type /bw info to see everything you must do

4. Do /bw set name (name) /bw set world_lobby (world name) /bw set lobby player_pos for spawn position and /bw set world_game (world name)

5. Next let's do map stuff! Set slots with /bw set slots (number)
Then do /bw set teams (team name) 0 (after 1) then 2 I suggest adding a color code like §aGreen or §cRed 

6. Next add villagers by doing /bw set villager 0 (counting up) player_loc

7. Setup beds with /bw set teambed (team) look_block

8. Then setup spawns with /bw set teamspawn (team) player_pos

9. Finally setup generators with /bw set generators 0 look_block (have either an iron, gold, or terracotta block below for Spawners)

10. Next do /save-all if you have edited the map or lobby

11. Do /bw savedata and then /bw savelevels then restart!

12. Type /bw join (map) to play! Have fun!
